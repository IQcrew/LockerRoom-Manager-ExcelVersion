# Locker room manager made for high school of information technologies in KNM by Tobias Mikula.
## Project Overview

This project was made using the Windows Forms from .NET Framework. It uses .xlsx Excel files to store information about the lockers in the school's locker rooms. The program graphically displays the lockers as images, and users can switch between rooms or search for specific information. The locker's availability is indicated by a green or red light, making it easy to tell if a locker is empty or not. Users can also graphically move lockers, align them, and perform group actions such as removing or adding lockers just by clicking buttons or selecting multiple lockers, making it user-friendly.

## Shortcuts
- **Ctrl+S** = Save
- **Esc** = Escape new locker mode
- **Ctrl/Shift + Click on locker** (even in filter) = Select locker
- **Delete** = Delete selected lockers
