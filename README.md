Locker room manager made for high school of information technologies in KNM by Tobias Mikula.
Project was made using the windows forms from .NET Framework.

It uses .xlsx Excel files to store information about the lockers in schools' locker rooms.
It graphicly displays them as images, you can switch between rooms or search for certain information, and you can see 
if locker is empty or not just by looking at its light if it's green or red.
You can graphicly move lockers and align, remove, or add lockers just by clicking buttons or selecting multiple lockers
for group actions, so it's considered user-friendly.


Shortcuts:
Ctrl+S = Save;
Esc = escape new locker room mode;
Ctrl/Shift + Click on locker (even in filter) = select locker;
delete = delete selected lockers;
